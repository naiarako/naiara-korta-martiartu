I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Biomedical Photonics group at the [Institute of Applied Physics](https://www.iap.unibe.ch/), University of Bern. I am an interdisciplinary ultrasound physicist passionate about the physics of ultrasound wave propagation phenomena in the context of medical imaging. I am interested in enhancing clinical ultrasound systems with tomographic images of tissue (an)elastic properties. These images will help us identify different tissue types and ultimately diagnose pathologies. My goal as a researcher is to bring a safe, low-cost, widely-available, high-resolution, and accurate medical imaging system to society. So far, my work has focused on diagnosing lesions in the breast, liver, and muscles.
