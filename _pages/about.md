I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Biomedical Photonics group at the [Institute of Applied Physics](https://www.iap.unibe.ch/), University of Bern. I am interested in the physics of ultrasound wave propagation for medical applications. I apply this knowledge to develop methods quantifying mechanical tissue properties, ultimately used to identify pathological tissues. So far, my work has focused on diagnosing lesions in the breast, liver, and muscles. 


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
